## What Are Chains?

Chains are sequences of prompts designed to be used together for complex tasks that require multiple steps.

## Available Chains

| Chain | Steps | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| [new-feature.md](new-feature.md) | 7 | Building a new feature from idea to deployment |
| [bug-fix.md](bug-fix.md) | 7 | Systematic debugging and fixing |
| [refactor.md](refactor.md) | 6 | Safe, incremental refactoring |
| [security-hardening.md](security-hardening.md) | 7 | Securing an application |
| [production-launch.md](production-launch.md) | 7 | Pre-launch preparation |

## How to Use

1. Open the chain file
2. Execute each step in order
3. Wait for completion before proceeding
4. Document findings between steps

## Chain Format

Each chain file contains:
- Overview of the workflow
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step prompts
- Expected outputs per step
- Decision points
