# MVP Only

> Constrain to minimum viable scope

## Snippet

```
MVP only. No nice-to-haves. What's the absolute minimum to deliver value?
```

## Usage

Use when:
- Time is limited
- Scope is creeping
- Need to validate fast
- Resources are constrained

## Examples

### Feature Design
```
Design a user authentication system.

MVP only. No nice-to-haves. What's the absolute minimum to deliver value?
```

### Implementation
```

MVP only. No nice-to-haves. What's the absolute minimum to deliver value?
```

## Variations

### Time-Boxed
```
I have 4 hours. What's the MVP I can ship in that time?
```

### V1 Only
```
This is v1. What do we absolutely need? Everything else is v2.
```

### 80/20
```
Apply the 80/20 rule. What 20% of features deliver 80% of value?
```
