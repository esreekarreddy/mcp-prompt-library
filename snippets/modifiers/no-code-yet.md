# No Code Yet

> Prevent AI from writing code prematurely

## Snippet

```
DO NOT write code yet. I need to review and approve the plan first.
```

## Usage

Use when you want:
- Planning before implementation
- To review approach before committing
- To catch issues before code exists
- Alignment before investment

## Examples

### With Implementation Plan

DO NOT write code yet. I need to review and approve the plan first.
```

### With Architecture
```

```

## Variations

### Analysis Only
```
Analyze only. Do not make changes.
```

### Proposal Mode
```
Propose a solution but wait for my approval before implementing.
```

### Explicit Separation
```
Phase 1: Plan (no code)
Phase 2: Implementation (after approval)

We are in Phase 1. Present the plan only.
```
