# Be Ruthless

> Request aggressive prioritization and cutting

## Snippet

```
Be ruthless. Cut aggressively. Question every assumption. Less is more.
```

## Usage

Use when:
- Scope is creeping
- Need to ship faster
- Prioritizing ruthlessly
- Cutting unnecessary complexity

## Examples

### With Scope
```

Be ruthless. Cut aggressively. Question every assumption. Less is more.

What's the absolute minimum we need to ship?
```

### With Code Review
```
Review this code for unnecessary complexity.

Be ruthless. Cut aggressively. Question every assumption. Less is more.
```

## Variations

### MVP Focus
```

```
This is too complex. Be ruthless. What can we remove entirely?
```

### Prioritization
```
Rank these by value/effort. Be ruthless. What's not worth doing?
```
